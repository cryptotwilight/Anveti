# Anveti
 This is the Anveti IPFS Search on Web3 project repository.
 
 The Anveti project has been created to push the boundaries of Web3 by introducing 
 EVM coordinated search over IPFS stored files. 
 
 The goal of Anveti is to create a platform that users can utilise to store and share data in an easy way hat 
 allows them to get compenstated for any data views. 
 
 The Demo for Anveti can be found here: 
 [DEMO](https://focused-kalam-af4d87.netlify.app/) https://focused-kalam-af4d87.netlify.app/
 
To use the Demo you need to connect to the Rinkeby Ethereum Network with Metamask. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSx14epF1lc)

You will then need to ensure your wallet has suffient network ETH which can be obtained [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

You will then be able to upload and interact with Anveti on the testnet. 

Points to Note: 
The 'Default' search will only search your own files and will return a count of other files it has found associated with your given search

When entering search terms these must be comma separated in the field with no spaces. 

All your data uploads are hosted on IPFS in the clear i.e. no encryption

The IPFS hash to your file is presented to you and only you for free unless you set the view price to zero whereby any user can view your data for free
