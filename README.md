# Anveti
 This is the Anveti IPFS Search on Web3 project repository.
 
 The Anveti project has been created to push the boundaries of Web3 by introducing 
 EVM coordinated search over IPFS stored files. 
 
 The goal of Anveti is to create a platform that users can utilise to store and share data in an easy way hat 
 allows them to get compenstated for any data views.
